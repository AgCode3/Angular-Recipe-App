# Angular-Recipe-App
Web application that lets you add, edit, delete recipes and shopping list items.  
Created from Maximilian Schwarzmuller's Course, Angular 8 (formerly Angular 2) - The Complete Guide, on Udemy.

1. To run this application you must downlad Node.js - https://nodejs.org/en/
2. Then run this command - npm install -g @angular/cli - in your command prompt to install angular globally.
3. Download the code from this repository
4. Open the folder shop-recipe-list in your favorite IDE. I used Visual Studio Code to create this project.
5. If you are using the terminal in your IDE you should be able to run the command - ng serve --open - and
   the browswer set in your IDE will open the URL localhost:4200 and display the app.
   If you are using the command prompt you will likely have to change directory to the app folder and then
   run - ng serve.
